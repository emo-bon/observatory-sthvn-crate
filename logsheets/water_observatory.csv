The phytoplankton growing season is from March – October and phytoplankton cell densities from Nov - Feb are very low. The site participated in the Ocean Sampling Day event in 2014. Harmful algae genera (Alexandrium, Dinophysis, Pseudo-nitzschia, Karenia) are detected annually at the Stonehaven monitoring site. The main chlorophyll peaks are recorded from May – June, but some years the highest chlorophyll values are recorded in late summer/autumn. Monitoring for full phytoplankton and zooplankton community analysis is performed alongside chlorophyll, secchi depth, temperature, salinity, TOxN, DIP, DSi, Total Alkalinity and Dissolved Organic Carbon.
