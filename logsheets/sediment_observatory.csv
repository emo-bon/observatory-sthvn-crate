The site harbours an infralittoral fine sand community dominated by amphipods from the genus Ampelisca, polychaetes (Spiophanes bombyx, Nepthys spp., Hyalinoecia bilineata, Marphysa bellii) and bivalves (Abra alba, Timoclea ovata). In parallel to biological samples, temperature, salinity and sediment grain size are measured at this site. Hydrological variables (temperature, salinity, nutrients, chl.a, MES,…..) are monitored since 1997 at two nearby stations (SOMLIT-Estacade and SOMLIT-Astan stations) in the framework of the national service SOMLIT. The main annual phytoplankton bloom, dominated by diatoms, occurs in May-June. The sampling site was polluted by hydrocarbons following the Amoco-Cadiz oil spill which occurred in March 1978, one year after the beginning of the monitoring program. Significant hydrocarbon concentrations were measured in the sediment from 1978 to 1981. No major pollution has been reported in the bay since 1978. An aggregate dredging site is present at 2 nautical miles in the orth of the sampling site. The sampling site is located in a Natura 2000 site.",Fabienne Rigaut-Jalabert,fabienne.jalabert@sb-roscoff.fr,,lithogenous
